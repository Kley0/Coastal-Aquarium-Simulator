===== COASTAL AQUARIUM SIMULATOR =====

================ INFO ================

Coastal Aquarium Simulator is a game
about an aquarist, you, maintaining 
and taking great care of an aquarium 
full of marine life for five days 
straight on a limited and low budget 
without letting it collapse and fail, 
leading to a game over. If you also run 
out of money on your budget, you lose 
as well! If you successfully maintain 
the aquarium for five days in a row, 
you win!

============ HOW TO PLAY ============

There will be six actions you can
perform on each day, each action would
consume a portion of your money budget.
These six actions help to maintain the 
aquarium and keep the marine life
within thriving and healthy. Be careful,
do not perform too many unnecessary 
actions, otherwise you may run your
budget dry and get a very quick game over.
On top, it displays the current Day, your
remaining Budget, the marine life's
Comfort, the marine life's Health, and
the Cleanliness of your own aquarium.
Below the aquarium are meter bars that
measure and indicate the Salinity, Ammonia,
PH Level, Oxygen, Temperature, and Filter
Status. When the meter is green, it is
relatively safe. If it is yellow, it is
much less safe. If it is red, it is 
dangerously low. The six actions you can do 
will do different things that can help 
maintain the aquarium and the marine life 
inside. Adjust Climate helps to lower the
temperature if it ever increases to 
dangerous levels. Feed Animals increases
the comfort of the animals, but will build
up Ammonia which would give you a game 
over should you overfeed the fish. Clean
Tank will increase the Cleanliness of your
aquarium and reduce the amount of Ammonia 
being built. Add Enrichment will improve 
the comfort of the marine life within the
aquarium. Repair Equipment will return
Oxygen and Temperature back to normal levels.
Lastly, Backwash Filter will keep the Filter
Status on Clean.

Underneath the six Actions buttons is an 
END DAY button which when pressed will let
you move on to the next day. However, for
every day that passes, there will be a daily 
upkeep that consumes $15 from your budget.
Not just that, there is a chance that a 
random event will occur on the next day. It
will either benefit you via placing your 
meters on safe levels or cause problems by 
placing your meters on dangerous levels.
Once you press END DAY on the Day 5 on
relatively safe levels, you have won the game.
Whether you lose or win, it will display a
win/lose message with a button that lets you
replay the game back to Day 1.
